Please check to see if the assignment goals are met.

## Goal

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

# Purpose

I believe the purpose of this assignment was to introduce the use of a NoSQL database. In this case, MongoDB Atlas was needed.
